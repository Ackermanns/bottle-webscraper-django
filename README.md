# bottle-webscraper-django

A full stack application that gets various Christchurch alcohol bottle product pricings from various stores, stores them in the database and shows the user where they can buy the cheapest registered retailer.
E.g. "I would like to know where can can buy the cheapest listed Jagermeister in the bottle shops of Christchurch".
This snuffs out any specials on and presents all the shops that sells Jagermeister.
